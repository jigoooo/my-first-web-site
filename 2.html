  <p>Wonpil is playing the keyboard and vocal in <strong>DAY6 and DAY6 (even of day)</strong>.<br>He released his first solo album called filmography on Feb. 27. <br>The filmography album contains a total of 10 songs, including the title track No. 1, 'Goodbye', and my favorite track is the last track, 'Wish me luck'. At the end of the song, it ends with "I'll be back."</p>

  <p>Yes... Wonpil will join the Republic of Korea Navy on March. My brother was recently discharged from the navy. <br>I wish my brother would go to the army one more time instead of Piri Miri. I hope he will come back safely and sing and do good activities again.</p>
