  <p><strong>LUCY</strong> is a four-member band consisting of Shin Ye-chan (Violin), Choi Sang-yeop (Vocal, Guitar), Cho Won-sang (Producing, Bass) and Shin Gwang-il (Vocal, Drum), the runner-up of JTBC ‘SUPER BAND’ in 2019. When it was appearing on ‘SUPER BAND’, it was loved for its unique music color and refreshing charm using Ambience Sound. Starting with <strong>‘Flowering’</strong>, in May 2020, it completed a four-season narrative, including ‘Jogging’, ‘Snooze’ and <strong>‘Hero’</strong>, showing distinctive musical colors. It held its first solo concert with the release of its fourth single album ‘Gatcha!’ in June 2021 and has established itself as a next-generation K-band with both musicality and popularity by selling out all seats before the online and offline concerts in July.</p>

  <p>I love Lucy's song very very very very much. One of the songs in my life is <strong>"Hero"</strong>. In particular, 'hero' and 'Flowering' go crazy when you hear them in spring. <br>Their songs combine guitar, drum, and vocal to create a fantastic harmony. <br>I like their songs, but I don't really care about the group itself, so I don't know much about them.</p>
